# 🎵 MuseCoco Text-to-MIDI Service

The **MuseCoco Text-to-MIDI Service** is a refactored version of the [MuseCoco](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic) repository, designed as a deployable service module. This service adapts to new data, manages the history of its checkpoints, and abstracts away the underlying implementation details to provide a seamless interface for generating MIDI files from textual inputs. Detailed comments are included to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the codebase.

## ⚙️ Installation

To install the **MuseCoco Text-to-MIDI Service**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/musecoco-text2midi-service.git
   cd musecoco-text2midi-service
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use `pip` to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To start the service, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the MuseCoco Text-to-MIDI Service, allowing you to convert textual descriptions into MIDI files through the defined APIs or CLI.

## 🔗 Integration

To integrate the **MuseCoco Text-to-MIDI Service** into your existing project:

1. **Install the Module**:

   Install the service as a package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e /path/to/musecoco-text2midi-service
   ```

2. **Import and Use Functions in Your Code**:

   Import the necessary functions or classes from the `control` or `view` modules:

   ```python
   from musecoco_text2midi_service.src.control import midi_generation_function

   # Example usage for generating MIDI from text
   midi_file = midi_generation_function("Generate a classical piano piece in C major")
   print(midi_file)
   ```

   Replace `midi_generation_function` with the specific function you wish to use.

## 🔧 Configuration

The service uses a YAML configuration file located at `storage/config/main_config.yaml`. You can modify this file to configure parameters such as model checkpoints, logging settings, and API keys.

Example configuration in `main_config.yaml`:

```yaml
midi_generation:
  model_checkpoint: "path/to/checkpoint"
logging:
  level: "INFO"
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will execute all test cases in the `tests` directory and provide a report of the test results.
